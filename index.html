<p>Doodles is one of the most notable NFT pfp projects out right now. Doodles is designed by Burnt Toast, an artist from Vancouver. His fun designs make this something that people of all ages can appreciate. Doodles started off with an artist and some team members, but over the past few months they have added some big names to the team. They hired a CEO named Julian Holguin, who was previously a president at Billboard. His experience with music and entertainment will bring many utilities and experiences to Doodle owners. Another move the team made was adding Pharrell as the Chief Brand Officer. This is one of the biggest names in music joining the team, so there are rumors that a Doodles album will be released in the near future. This album will be produced by Pharrell, and the album artwork will be done by Burnt Toast. Doodles are not a cheap buy for anyone, but they should be at the top when it comes to the future of NFTs. They are currently priced at a floor price of 8 eth, which is around 11,000 U.S. dollars. They reached a peak of 25 eth, which at the time was around 75,000 U.S. dollars.</p>
